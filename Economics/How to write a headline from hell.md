# How to write a headline from hell

	I can't speak for anyone who worked with me. These are my own opinions, even when I say 'we', I mean 'just me', your Honour.

Looking at these front pages of devastation and human heroism should make me swell with pride. Pride for my colleagues who endured hell to cover disaster after disaster.

But it doesn't.

It makes me feel like a fraud.

I wasn't there for a single moment of back-breaking toil to sandbag against the oncoming storm. I never once looked back as my home burst against the firewall. Not once did I pick through the debris of a life destroyed by a natural disaster, or crime, or disease, or the loss of a town's last major employer.

My job was to take the words written by journalists who were there, take out the artifacts of the real damage the trauma had done, and replace it with the emotion everyone expected to see.

Stop. Wait. Before you raise your arms in protest — from whichever side of my previous comment you're on — it was only a subtle change.

Regional journalists exist in a permanent state of near-collapse. They are only at their most energetic when threatened by disaster. Otherwise, they're too overworked to avoid errors in their work. Those errors were once caught by subeditors with preternatural attention to detail.

They were all axed until the only ones left were management, the journalists, and the producers sitting comfortably out of harm's way.

Management still somehow found a way to get the papers out to the community despite budgets so small they had to become the best in the world at it.

The journalists still somehow found a way to deliver genuinely local, genuinely insightful news, despite working the jobs of their three colleagues who were just laid off.

Oh, and those comfy producers? I was one of those for ten years. You could almost say I was an especially good one (to have lasted that long, at least).

We were fine. We were safely away from any fires, floods, or firearms. We were the ones who filled your Facebook feeds with nonsense about some British celebrity having a boozer and yelling at the pap with their clothes half off.

Have you ever wondered why we post those articles?

I've always wondered what people thought the answers to these questions were, too.

   - Why do we post articles about news from nowhere near us?
   - Why do we take the most important information out of the headline?
   - Why do we keep pushing stories about topics that always start fights?
   - Why do we sensationalise everything we post?
   - Why do we keep posting every stupid thing Trump/Peter Evans/Pauline Hanson says?

Because I've always wondered, and I've had ten years of opportunity to do so, I've physically gone out and asked people what they thought the answers were. There isn't much variation from this one, simple response.

    To get clicks from idiots.

It's an answer as wrong as it is insulting to a generally clever readership. I learned very quickly as a younger news producer to never underestimate the intelligence of our readers. Here are the real answers to why we post those yarns.

   - We post about the road fatality that happened nowhere near you because human empathy doesn't have a geological range attached to it. We share those yarns across the network because they are sad across the network and that human life was important without diminution by range. Most get this, the noisy few don't.
  -  We take the important parts out because otherwise some people won't click to read the story and will miss the important nuances of the situation. Take the ScomoBucks situation. Too many people thought they were getting a payday from the PM because all they read was the headline and maybe a Facebook tease. The majority were laughing at them a week later.
  -  We don't push yarns that start fights — we actively avoid them — we push yarns that are about subjects people need to keep in their thoughts no matter how much they'd rather not think about it. Domestic abuse, misogyny, homophobia, transphobia, are all topics that lose us traffic but we publish because it's the right thing to do. Even News Corp knows it's 2020 and sweeping queers under the bed isn't good enough anymore.
  -  We sensationalise our stories, and I admit we have to chase our own records a lot here — because we're competing with the visual equivalent of meth, Candy Crush. You and I both know that you scan headlines a certain way, we'll always work out what that way is, and you'll never see the dictator taking over if we don't make the headline more interesting than the zap you get to your brain's pleasure centre when you line up four blocks of the same colour on your phone. That doesn't make you stupid, that makes you efficient.
  -  This speaks to the last bullet point. We post every uninformed, malignant, goofy brainspill these people utter because the vast majority of people are smart, but if you don't keep the spotlight on the crazies, they have a habit of building followings who suddenly work out how to rig elections. So yes, we are giving them a stage, and roughly the right amount of rope.

The eagle-eyed among you may have noticed that I've skipped two things in the latter bullet-list. The first is that I skipped answering why we publish useless frivolity about celebrities in news posts that go nowhere, help nobody, and accomplish nothing. The answer is for respite against the more important subject I've avoided — why did I, the comfortable, removed production editor write the headline "How to write headlines from hell"?

I can tell you how to write headlines from hell because we weren't removed from the hells of floods, fires, crimes, drugs, child abusers, wife beaters, elder abusers, and lives snuffed out in every way possible. I can tell you because my team and I were in the central circle of that pit, with every tragedy from every corner of the world forced into our minds for as long as we worked there.

There is no distance at which heartbreak crumbles into dust. Like gravity, it perpetuates indefinitely. Each member of that team over the years I had the honour of being a part of it, ended each day with a world of papercuts across their mind. Even the mentally healthy didn't stay that way for long or just outright left.

Hundreds of stories each day somehow found new ways to describe horror and cruelty. From the slow-bruise feeling of watching the economy melt to the existential terror of a child's accidental death, we encountered each a dozen times a day and had to parse it through our heads and onto the public conscious.

You write headlines from hell by refusing to let your humanity come out in your writing. You replace it with your love for the humanity still left out there and write to keep it alive.

The NRM network of journalists, editors, subeditors, and digital producers, have earned my deepest respect for the hell they have or will experience just doing their job. These are some of the real reasons behind my editorial decisions.
