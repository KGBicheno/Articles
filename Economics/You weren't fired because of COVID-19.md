# You weren't fired because of COVID-19

Management did everything they could to keep as many jobs as they could in my case.

I watched as they fought the good fight against a global foe that not even the best regional news team in the world could withstand. In the end, sadly, there was only so much they could do, and nearly their entire staff had to be culled.

But this was well before we started working from home to prevent an outbreak of COVID-19 spreading through the office. The decision had been made months prior to staff being informally informed via a new regime of 3-day work-weeks.

The culls entered management's to-do lists 12-18 months ago, all of it was plainly written across macroeconomic indicators from one end of the textbook to the other.

Consumer sentiment approaching the Christmas shopping season in 2019 would have been worth weeks of headlines were it not for the bushfire crisis.

Alone they formed their own crisis as they hovered around the 95-97% mark in the months before Christmas. As scary as that was, it was a vast improvement on the 92% it bottomed out to in October.

#### Consumer sentiment from July 2019

For those wondering how to read the chart, 100% means consumers in the economy have what is considered a 'normal' desire to go out shopping. A number above 100% means they're more inclined to go out shopping while a number less than 100% means they're less inclined.

If we look at those numbers over a longer period of time, say, twenty-five years, and we get some context on just how hard we should have been wetting our pants about those numbers.

#### 25 years of consumer sentiment

Christmas-time consumer sentiment is usually its peak and, apart from the 2008-09 financial crisis, never remotely close to being as bad as it was last year.

What sets this apart from the previous financial crisis, however, is that 2008 was surrounded by periods of quite high consumer sentiment and, at least in Australia, quite solid economic growth.

This time, we're in a situation where interest rates are tuned to "holy mother of God spend!", the RBA is unable to light the fire of inflation, and our labour market is so far into the inflationary zone that figures all the way back to 2014 show chronic underemployment and underutilisation.

That last part is important because it means we've spent too long not growing our economy's real capacity to do anything new.

Here's a shortlist of fiscal policies any government in the last ten years could have done to change this:

-    Nationalised the NBN and worn the cost of finishing it. (Promotes decentralisation and growth of regional jobs and communities)
-    Introduced an energy security policy demanding no one power source account for more than x per cent of generation and must be available for x duration in the event of international isolation. (Promotes the growth of renewable energy production while ensuring the technology is sourced nationally and that fuel for legacy power is also sourced nationally)
-    Introduced a biosecurity policy demanding R&D funding into a series of food production density milestones. (Promotes genetic and agricultural research as well as promoting technologies such as vertical farming)

I know people often rankle at the mention of government-mandated influence on markets, but each of these is neutral to the status quo of who-owns-what except for the first one. Given the overwhelming proportion of SMEs who benefit from the NBN being completed by the government instead of in stasis under Telstra, it seems like a no-brainer.

Also, the list isn't exhaustive. Go to any Mayor or Premier and ask them for an infrastructure wishlist and they'll have one stretching unto the heat death of the universe.

## "Where did it all go wrong?"

There may have been a point where most people who wanted a job had some form of employment, but they fell into two categories.

-    Those who were overloaded with work and being burned out across multiple jobs.
-    Those who wanted more work but could only find a few hours here and there but not enough to support themselves.

Early last year the rhetoric engine broke down and macroeconomic figures that had previously looked fine because they were poorly constructed had to be fudged or outright lied about in the media (I would know, I was a relatively senior part of that process) to try to keep people and businesses from going into a panic.

So now Scotty from marketing's election win has become the weirdest blessing in Australian history for two reasons.

 -  The economy has completely blown apart under the party stereotypically seen as the 'economic ones' so this won't be seen as a partisan problem and we can go straight to just blaming the government for forgetting fiscal policy existed until too late instead of which government forgot.
 -   The only party with the members foolhardy enough to challenge the measures needed to combat COVID-19 as a pandemic are in power instead of opposition, meaning the opposition of the day is smart enough to let the obvious solutions go through. 

It also explains the urgency with which Morrison was put in charge of the party instead of the more capable Julie Bishop — there's a certain frequency of 'normalcy' required to pass off the economic furfies the press pack has been fed lately. Bishop is too articulate to sound natural lying as if out of ignorance.

So the likelihood that you would have made it to the end of 2020 with your job intact if you were made redundant recently is not high.

If I had to put my money on what would have caused a similar round of mass lay-offs this year, it would have been something like one of the following:

-    China and the US would have entered a currency war with SWIFT coming under attack by China's proxies while Beijing backs the digital alternatives already operating across south-east Asia. These systems would have huge launches across African nations, including some form of official adoption, probably in Ethiopia. The economic fallout from the currency war would have hit our construction and mining industries so hard our entire economy would have experienced coronavirus-level disruption. Goodbye jobs.
-    The property market would have collapsed as two previously unrelated crises, unpaid subcontractors and residential building defects finally hit one of the larger construction companies who misjudged an at-cost contract. That one event alone wouldn't wipe out the economy, but it would turn some fairly middle-importance investigations into a royal commission that at the very least would hit industry and investor confidence hard enough to cause dominos to go down everywhere. The economy isn't strong enough to handle anything close to that right now. As contrived as this sounds, there's enough pressure on the housing sector for something, if not this, something else, to go horribly wrong. Goodbye jobs.
-    The private health insurance industry collapses. Included only because it's a walking market failure and anyone who's done introductory economics knows this. Goodbye and thanks for all the absolute falsehoods you tried to pass off onto us as press releases. 

## "I'm pretty sure I lost my job because of the pandemic"

This article isn't trying to say you're bad at your job and your management were simply waiting for a chance to toss you out of the airlock. My argument here is that one way or another, we would have seen job losses of this magnitude this year even had COVID-19 not hit.

The losses may have been spread over a longer period, but it's likely that once a single large company hit the button, the primary media would have labelled it the start of an economic collapse and other industries would have followed the narrative — just like they're doing now.

## "So if you're so smart, why didn't you see it coming?"

That's the wrong question. The question should be "What did you do once you saw it coming?"

I pulled up my socks at work, my wife and I dramatically changed our spending habits, we cleared our debt and saved like hell until we had a house deposit. We settled on the smallest but most appropriate new apartment in Brisbane we could find only days before banks stopped processing loan applications because of the pandemic.

Our housemate at the time was a week too late.

As much as that comes out as bragging, I want it to go towards the persuasiveness of the rest of this article. So if you take only one thing from this yarn, take this:

    Yes, coronavirus punched an enormous hole in the world's economy, but if we leave our understanding of this year's torrent of job losses there, we fail to learn the real lessons Australia's economic leaders need to learn.

One look at the economic data leading up to the pandemic makes every article I published about job losses seem a little disingenuous. Here, I explain why, and the one thing you need to take away from this article.
