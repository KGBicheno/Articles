## Opinion

The opportunity cost for jobseekers to study has never been this low.

So get certs before they jack up the price.

Again.

Every hour spent studying now negatively impacts your chance of finding a job now less than ever before.

The mad scramble is just grinding the economy's gears. Put up your LinkedIn. Put up your Seek profile. Make a portfolio site and consultancy rates card. Then put the search cost on recruiters.

Wages will fall less. Productivity will fall less as genuine recruitment efforts pick up (search instead of filtering). And we increase the future productivity of the economy by having a better-trained labour force.

Also, with the cost of credit at an all-time low, it's the best time to attempt to cut costs and live on one income â€” the GDP is in free-fall anyway. We need cultural change in Australia and this is our best chance to bring it about.

It's our best chance to experiment with:
- one-income households
- mates-based share houses with agreed support roles
- polyamorous households with agreed support roles
- mass down-sizing
- mass regulatory change

Because the country is currently ballistic. If you think we have a wheel with which to steer this, I have a bridge to sell you.
